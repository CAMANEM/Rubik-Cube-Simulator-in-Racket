# Rubik Cube Simulator in Racket

This is a simulation of a rubik's cube movements, where the user gives the movements that wants to do, and optionaly an intial state of the cube. 

This program was made as a homework for the *compiler and interpreter languages* course of the career Computer Engineering in the Instituto Tecnológíco de Costa Rica. For this homework it was forbidden to use iteration in the cube logic (except in the GUI), and other functions and use of variables.

### How to use:
The program works on windows and linux if you have racket installed. Look how to use the program with the ![user manual](https://github.com/CAMANEM/Rubik-Cube-Simulator-in-Racket/blob/main/docs/Manual%20de%20Usuario.pdf).

### The program can run cubes from dimensions of 2x2 to 6x6:

The movements used for the examples shown are: '("F1D" "C2B" "C1B" "F1D")
